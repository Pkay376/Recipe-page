            <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans or line them with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the buttermilk and red food coloring. Mix well.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, alternating with the buttermilk mixture, beginning and ending with the flour mixture. Mix until just combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in the white vinegar and mix for an additional 1-2 minutes until the batter is smooth and evenly colored.</li>
            <li>Divide the batter equally between the prepared cake pans.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Remove the cakes from the oven and allow them to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>While the cakes are cooling, prepare the cream cheese frosting. In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and butter until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the powdered sugar, one cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
            <li>Once the cakes have cooled completely, place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread a layer of cream cheese frosting on top.</li>
            <li>Place the second cake layer on top and frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining cream cheese frosting.</li>
            <li>Decorate the cake as desired. You can use cake crumbs, sprinkles, or additional frosting.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate the cake for at least an hour before serving to allow the frosting to set.</li>
